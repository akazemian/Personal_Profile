I’m a cognitive science researcher interested in understanding how brains and machines encode and process information. Humans possess the ability to seamlessly make sense of auditory and visual data, despite the noisy and ambiguous nature of the world. We also represent this information in a way that enables efficient learning and generalization in new situations. My passion lies in understanding these abilities, and developing AI that can more closely emulate them.

Currently, I am a research assistant at the Department of Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, where I’m working with my advisor <a href="https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/michael-bonner/">Dr. Michael Bonner</a> to reverse engineer the representations and algorithms of human visual cognition through computational modeling. In the fall of 2024, I will be starting my PhD at Stanford, where I will be co-advised by <a href="[https://lauragwilliams.github.io/]">Dr. Laura Gwilliams and <a href="[https://stanford.edu/~yamins/]">Dr. Dan Yamins. 

Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree from the Integrated Engineering program at the University of British Columbia.

Here is my <a href="https://akazemian.github.io/research/CV.pdf">CV</a>!
