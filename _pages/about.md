Hi!

I’m a first-year PhD student at Stanford University. I’m interested in how humans transform sensory information into higher-level concepts and meaning, and in developing AI that emulates this ability more efficiently. Currently, I’m working with my advisors, <a href="https://lauragwilliams.github.io/">Dr. Laura Gwilliams</a> and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~yamins/">Dr. Dan Yamins</a>, on brain-inspired models of speech and language.

Prior to this, I completed my Masters in Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, where I worked with <a href="https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/michael-bonner/">Dr. Michael Bonner</a> on understanding the representations and algorithms of primate visual cortex by studying the properties of high dimensional untrained vision models. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Integrated Engineering from the University of British Columbia.
