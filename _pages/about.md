I’m a cognitive science researcher interested in understanding how brains and machines encode and process information. Humans possess the ability to seamlessly make sense of a diverse array of visual stimuli, and generalize exisiting knowledege to new situations. On the other hand, current large-scale deep learning models exhibit certain human-like behaviors after training on massive datasets. My passion lies in studying the similarities and differences betwee the representations and behaviors of these two systems. Doing so can advance our understanding of biological intelligence while supporting the development of human inspired Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I am a research assistant at the Department of Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, where I’m working with my advisor <a href="https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/michael-bonner/">Dr. Michael Bonner</a> on studying the properties of neural representations in the visual cortex using a computational modeling approach. 

I received my bachelor's degree from the Integrated Engineering program at UBC, which equipped me with the necessary skills to employ various engineering disciplines in solving real-world problems through building product prototypes.

Outside of academics, I’m passionate about all things nature, painting and learning new skills.
