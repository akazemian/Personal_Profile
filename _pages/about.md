Hi!

Iâ€™m a first year PhD student at Stanford Univesity. I'm interested in understanding how brains and machines encode and process information. Using our senses, we extract meaningful information from the world with incredible ease and efficiency, despite the high noise level in real world data. We encode this information in such a way that enables learning and generalization in new situations without the need for millions of training examples. I hope to understand the computational principles underlying these abilities by developing brain-inspired deep learning models. 

I work with <a href="https://lauragwilliams.github.io/">Dr. Laura Gwilliams</a> and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~yamins/">Dr. Dan Yamins</a> on developing computational models of speech and language. 

Prior to my PhD, I completed my Masters in Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, where I worked with Dr. <a href="https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/michael-bonner/">Dr. Michael Bonner</a> on understanding the representations and algorithms of primate visual cortex by studying the properties of high dimensional untrained vision models. In Fall 2024, I will be starting my PhD at Stanford, where I will be co-advised by <a href="https://lauragwilliams.github.io/">Dr. Laura Gwilliams</a> and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~yamins/">Dr. Dan Yamins</a>. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Integrated Engineering from the University of British Columbia.
