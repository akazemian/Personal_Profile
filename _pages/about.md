I’m a cognitive science researcher interested in understanding how brains and machines encode and process information. Humans possess the ability to seamlessly make sense of a diverse array of visual stimuli, and generalize exisiting knowledege to new situations. On the other hand, current large-scale deep learning models exhibit certain human-like behaviors after training on massive datasets. My passion lies in studying the similarities and differences between the representations and behaviors of these two systems. 

Currently, I am a research assistant at the Department of Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, where I’m working with my advisor <a href="https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/michael-bonner/">Dr. Michael Bonner</a> on studying the properties of neural representations in the visual cortex using a computational modeling approach. 

Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree from the Integrated Engineering program at UBC.

Outside of academics, I’m passionate about all things nature, playing tennis (though I'm still learning) and trying new things.

Here is my <a href="https://akazemian.github.io/cv/">CV</a>!
